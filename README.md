## Introduction

This repository contains the backend source code for the **Image To Parts** Roblox Game. This tool allows users to convert image URLs into parts within Roblox. Users are free to use the files provided in this repository for their own purposes.

## How It Works
Here’s a overview of the process:
1. Input an image URL and select a quality setting (such as mid, high, low, extra low).
2. The image URL and selected quality are sent to **Vercel**.
3. Vercel checks the image for nsfw and if its sfw than Vercel downloads the image and runs a Python script based on your selection.
4. A Lua script is generated and sent back to Roblox, where it is processed into parts that resemble the pixels of your image.

## FAQ

**Q: Do my uploaded images get logged? (All Models and Github)**
######
**A:** Uploaded images are temporary logged, they cannot be downloaded, viewed, or anything, unless its in Roblox.

##### -

**Q: What type images does this filter? (All Models and Github)**
######
**A:** Gore, Violence, Sexual Content, and Cuss Word types too.

##### -

**Q: What are the chances of a image bypassing detection? (Other)**
######
**A:** A probability range of 5% to 12%.

##### -

**Q: Why is the send gif function split into different files? (Model-3F and Above)**
######
**A:** Since this whole project is free, I can't edit the timeout time. So I spit the send gif function into different files, so it wouldn't timeout when uploading the frames. 

##### -

**Q: Why is the animation player not working? (Model-2F)**
######
**A:** Please read this: [fix](https://github.com/coltenthefirst/image-to-roblox/issues/5)

##### -

**Q: Why is the animation player not working? (Model-3F)**
######
**A:** Sometimes the api key can get rate limited and for it to work again, you would have to wait a hour. Or you can make another api key, delete the old one, and use the new one. I don't have a fix for this yet but, I could make it send to another image hoster, or I could make a script that checks if the api key works or not, and if it doesn't than what it would do is use another api key. I will fix this in Model-3.5.

##### -

**Q: How can I help on this project? (Other)**
